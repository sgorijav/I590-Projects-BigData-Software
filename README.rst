Final Project
===============================================================================

This is the repository for the class final project. 
Project Title: NoSQL Performance Benchmarking
Group members: Srinivasa Gorijavolu, Michael Mzyk, Satish Patharkar 


Directory Structure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following directories have been used for organizing the deliverables:

* data: Sample datasets/input/intermediate files are located in *data* directory
* docs: Final reports/additional documents are located in *docs* directory
* queries: All evaluated queries (MongoDB, Cassandra) can be found here



General Remarks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* While we kept using Chef as configuration and deployment tool, we tried to make
 the documentation of all installation, configuration and deployment scripts as 
 transparent as possible. 
* Note that our decision to work with Chef is motivated by its maturity, stability and 
exceptional position in the market as leading automation platform - all of us work in 
the Big Data industry and wanted to learn a new tool that is highly popular in the industry 
(which cannot be said about Ansible).
